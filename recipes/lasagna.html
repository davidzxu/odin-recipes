    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="description">A rich and creamy pasta dish filled layer by layer with refreshingly fresh onions and garlic, lathered in a succulent meat sauce and topped with imported, premium quality mozzarella.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>0.75 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>0.5 cups minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>28 ounces crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>6.5 ounces tomato sauce</li>
        <li>0.5 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoons fennel seeds</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>0.75 pounds mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>0.75 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 Â½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 0.5 teaspoons salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
